# Some Tips About Wiring

**>** Led wiring left to right should be: **D0, D2, D5, D1, D7, D8** (if you will look from opposite side, you can make it reverse).
<br>
**>** You have to connect every anode pin of leds to ground (g) pin with resistor, otherwise your led will probably burn out, **330 ohm is recommended.**
<br>
**>** You can ground multiple leds to one g pin if you don't have space.
<br>
**>** You don't need to ground the buzzer with resistor, just connect its cathode to g with any wire.
